## ðŸ”Ž Actionable Insight
- **Focus products:** Credit cards and checking/savings generate the most complaints â€” prioritize these for root-cause analysis. 
- **Top issue:** *Managing an account* is the largest single issue category (~8.8K) â€” consider improving account management UX and communication.  
- **Operational strength & gap:** High timely-response rate (98.1%) shows operational responsiveness, but a 9.71% dispute rate suggests improvements are needed in resolution quality or documentation. 
- **Staffing & prevention:** Monthly spikes (e.g., March, May) indicate periods for increased staffing or proactive outreach.   
- **Regional prioritization:** Complaints cluster in high-population states (CA, NY, FL, TX) â€” use this to prioritize regional investigation and resource allocation.
